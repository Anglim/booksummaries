## Chapter 1 - Welcome to Software Construction

The construction phase of software development focuses on activities such as coding, debugging and testing. It is the central activity that comes after requirements and architecture, and before systems testing.

Other terms for construction are "coding" and "programming".

Specific tasks involved in construction include:
- Verifying that the groundwork (specs, architecture, etc...) has been laid so that construction can proceed successfully
- Determining how the code will be tested
- Designing and writing classes and routines
- Creating and naming variables and constants
- Selecting control structures and organising blocks of statements
- Unit testing, integration testing and debugging your own code
- Reviewing other team member's low-level designs and code
- Polishing code through formatting and comments
- Integrating components that were created separately
- Tuning code to improve speed and reduce resources needed
